Add features to the simple OOP support ticket application we developed in class. You should add the following features and some extra features of your own design.
•Add a SQL Server database to store tickets. What information do you need to store for a support ticket?


•You should be able to save resolved tickets to the database. Will you use the same table, or a separate one?
use seperate dialog to resolve tickets 

•You should be able to prioritize tickets - by rating tickets by severity of the problem 

•You will need to manage a list of technicians who will work on tickets - again, store persistently in a database
seperate dialog window for technicians

•You should be able to assign tickets to a certain technician - create a window to assign tickets to a certain technician

•You should be able to email a work list to a technician - click of a button to open a seperate dialog window 

•You should be able to resolve a ticket, email the person who opened the ticket, and save it to the resolved list 

•Help or documentation to help a user with the application  - use an about window or help window to help the user figure out how to use the app

•You should add some extra features of your own design - confirm your extra features with me before you begin coding. - think of some extra features.
