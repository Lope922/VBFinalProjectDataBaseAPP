# VBFinalProjectDataBaseAPP
This app should come with some documentation. So as it developes... I will add info. Here is a basic checklist of what this app should contain. 
Add features to the simple OOP support ticket application we developed in class. You should add the following features and some extra features of your own design.
•Add a SQL Server database to store tickets. What information do you need to store for a support ticket?


•You should be able to save resolved tickets to the database. Will you use the same table, or a separate one?
use seperate dialog to resolve tickets 

•You should be able to prioritize tickets - by rating tickets by severity of the problem 

•You will need to manage a list of technicians who will work on tickets - again, store persistently in a database
seperate dialog window for technicians

•You should be able to assign tickets to a certain technician - create a window to assign tickets to a certain technician

•You should be able to email a work list to a technician - click of a button to open a seperate dialog window 

•You should be able to resolve a ticket, email the person who opened the ticket, and save it to the resolved list 

•Help or documentation to help a user with the application  - use an about window or help window to help the user figure out how to use the app

•You should add some extra features of your own design - think of some extra features. 
Some basic features that i have thought of so far are... 
-- adding a unique id number to the tickets, but get the basics working first, also maybe a login screen so we know who the user is when sending an e-mail.
